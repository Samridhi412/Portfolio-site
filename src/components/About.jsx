      The first time four years ago I heard the concept of website development, I fell in love with it. To build something many people will use and spend time on daily is my primary motivation for Software Development.
      Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at a start-up, a huge corporation. These days, my main focus is working on making efficient and scalable products in Byjus.
      I'm a skilled software developer with experience in C++, Python, Ruby, Golang, Sql, Postgres, MongoDB and
      JavaScript, and expertise in frameworks like Django, Rails, React. I'm a quick learner and collaborate closely with clients to
      create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions that solve
      real-world problems. Let's work together to bring your ideas to life!

          <ServiceCard key={service.title} index={index} {...service} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
